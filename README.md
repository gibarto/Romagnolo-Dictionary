# Romagnolo-Dictionary
Files for a Romagnolo Dictionary in progress with English-Romagnolo and Italian-Romagnolo

At present, the only dictionaries for Romagnolo go from Romagnolo to Italian. This isn't very handy
if you want to look up the Romagnolo word for something. I am creating a dictionary with Lexique Pro
that can generate Italian-Romagnolo and English-Romagnolo glossaries to be put into "print" with
CreateSpace and in PDF format. Please view the license. This is not my get rich project so I am glad
to have the information freely available for those who are interested.
