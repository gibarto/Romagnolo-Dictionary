# Romagnolo-Dictionary
Files for the Romagnolo Starter Dictionary now in first Edition, with English and Italian indexes

At present, the only dictionaries for Romagnolo go from Romagnolo to Italian. This isn't very handy
if you want to look up the Romagnolo word for something. I have created a starter dictionary for Romagnolo using glossary and dictionary entries from online resources put into a LexiquePro dictionary file. Using LexiquePro, I also generated English and Italian indexes, and published the whole thing with Kindle Publishing as a paperback. Romagnolo Starter Dictionary, updated with the edition 1 commit, is the final update before publishing. It is free for download and distribution but may not be sold. Copies may only be printed for personal use. If you would like a paper copy for yourself or someone else, you can purchase the completed book on Amazon for $9.95.
